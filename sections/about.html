            <p>I'm a PhD student under the supervision of Prof. Peyman Z Moghadam and Prof. Mojtaba Abdi-Jalebi at University College London (UCL) since 2023.</p>
            <p>I am passionate about applying machine learning to advance molecular research, especially in Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs). My focus includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Chemical representation and QSPR modeling:</strong> Developing chemical embeddings and predictive models to understand and accelerate structure-property relationships.</li>
                    <li><strong>Generative and multimodal AI for material design:</strong> Leveraging diffusion models and large language models (LLMs) to create and interpret novel materials across multiple data modalities.</li>
                </ul>
