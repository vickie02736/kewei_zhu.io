            <p>I'm a PhD student under the supervision of Prof. Peyman Z Moghadam and Prof. Mojtaba Abdi-Jalebi at University College London (UCL) since 2023.</p>
            <p>I am passionate about applying machine learning to advance molecular research, especially in Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs). My research focuses on leveraging advanced AI techniques to accelerate scientific discovery, with emphasis on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>large language models and their applications, such as text mining, multimodal pretraining, and post-training;</li>
                <li>conditional generative models, including LLaDA-series, flow matching, diffusion, VAE, and GAN frameworks;</li>
                <li>machine learning potentials for molecular simulations;</li>
                <li>applications of time-series models in computational fluid dynamics (CFD)</li>
            </ul>
